            Cyberbullying is a severe problem we face today 
            in the modern world where people can hide behind their screens. 
            As a result of having no other way of releasing their anger and pain
            cyberbullies resort to sending horrible messages or spreading 
            inappropriate pictures that will mentally damage their victims immensely.

            The Internet enables us to be anonymous. It enables us to become
            someone else behind the screens and have a different identity, 
            which leads to a conception that your actions on the internet do not 
            have as many consequences than your actions in real life, literally 
            enabling us to go over the line and attack someone, do or say something 
            we will never say to another person face to face, with us not realising 
            it most of the time. That is why many people end up saying cruel, sinister
            insults to other people without really realizing the weight of those
            words. So basically, bullying on the Internet, or cyber bullying, 
            can happen much easier than normal bullying.

            Cyberbullying provides all of the normal pains of normal bullying, yet, 
            due to the nature of the anonymity of the internet, provides the perpetrators 
            with a faceless outlet. Their facelessness allows them to tear down as much 
            as they please since they do not see any real consequence.

            My thoughts on cyber bullying is simply, people who fear physical confrontation 
            and are too scared to say what they feel face to face. Cyber-bullying is an 
            everyday occurrence and I feel that it happens ever so often, some of us don't 
            even realise what we are saying to people online until it causes a reaction to 
            the victim/victims and that's terrifying.

            I think cyber bullying is not a very good thing. Bullying someone else
            physically, face to face is already very unmoral . And doing it online,
            anonymously is still not okay, and it's worse because the victim 
            does not have enough information to confront the other person and solve
            the problem.

            Cyberbullying is a tragic experience whether is today, yesterday or tomorrow. 
            It is a way of making people lose hope in themselves through the internet by 
            an anonymous person. It basically gives the after effects of crushing 
            dreams, therefore cyberbullying is a crime, a terrifying one, and I think I 
            should be stopped. I do know a few people who have been cyber bullied, but I 
            have not been through it myself. I do know that it changed their lives a took them 
            a long time to move on with their lives as it changed them and their paths.

            Cyberbullying is bullying through social media and its incredibly harmful.

            hurtful and harmful as cyberbullying.

            Cyberbullying is another form of bullying that's also a serious problem. 
            Due to lack of parental awareness with any potential cyberbullying, children 
            aren't safe at school or home. I think social media platforms should take steps 
            to counter this type of bullying.

            I think that the rate of cyberbullying has raised really high nowadays, and 
            cyberbullies are cowards that hide behind their profiles. People commit suicide
            because of cyberbullying or so self harm because they think that the bully is right, 
            it can make people go into serious depression and that stuff can scar not only the 
            victim but the people around the victim.

            I do not support it, as its effect can be on par with real life bullying and the

            to feel safe online again and they might not trust people they meet online.

            I think cyberbullying is a increasing problem. More young people are putting
            themselves out there on the internet and making it easier for others to judge
            them. I think cyber bullying can hurt a person's self-esteem a lot because
            people are judging and generalizing someone based on one little piece of them
            that they see.
