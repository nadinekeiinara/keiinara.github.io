6. #JusticeforAudrey the number one trending hashtag worldwide in April 2019. 
Audrey died because of a fight that originated from cyberbullying. 
Audrey often insulted a student, saying that her deceased mother liked 
to borrow money, through social media. After seeing this, the student was enraged
and fought with Audrey through social media. Audrey told this student that she
wanted to finish the fight face to face. This resulted in physical fighting between 
Audrey and this student. This student also asked her friends to join in the fight, 
but they claim to have fought one at a time, while reports said that a group of students
attacked her all at once. As the police investigated, they identified several suspects,
who were then announced to the media, causing these suspects to in turn be terrorized 
and threatened. However, some of these suspects were not even at the scene of the crime,
making them victims to cyberbullying as well. Cyberbullying is a vicious cycle and this is 
just one of the many many stories that show that.

7. Popular Indonesian singer Ussy Sulistiawaty reported a cyberbullying case to the police in 2018, 
in which her daughter, Nur Amalina Putri, is a victim, late 2018. She stated 10 instagram 
accounts which have targeted Nur. These ten instagram accounts have constantly been bullying
Nur and body shaming her, stressing Nur and making her lose confidence in herself and her body, 
up to the point where she didn't want to eat. Ussy was deeply saddened and helped Nur through 
this time, resolving to report it under article 310 of the Indonesian criminal code (KUHP) as 
well as article 45 of the constitution (Undang-undang) number 11, 2008. She did this not only
to bring justice for her child, but also for all the children of Indonesia.

8. During her teenage years, a female university student was cyberbullied. 
A group of her female friends strongly disliked her for a reason she herself
didn't know and they formed a facebook group to bully her and mock her, saying
she was a lesbian and antisocial. This group of friends then invited all the girls 
in this girl's class to join the group, where they all talked about this girl 
behind her back. This caused the girl to have to avoid all the girls and caused her to
could only befriend boys. This went on and some girls eventually confessed that they were a 
part of the group, they said that they did it so that they won't be like her. Now, nearly 6 years 
later, she still has a trauma of befriending girls. Cyberbullying brings about numerous 
phsychological effects and trauma towards teenagers, which will greatly affect them not
just in their teenage years, but for the rest of their lives.
