            <P>
            We are 4 students who saw firsthand how detrimental the effects of cyberbullying can 
            be, especially towards teens in Indonesia. This is why we have created this website, 
            in hopes that cyberbullying can be an issue that is talked about in Indonesia,
            not just stigmatized and frowned upon.

                <p>
                Cyberbullying can be defined in a lot of ways, its dictionary definition being
                the act of harassing someone online by sending or posting mean messages, 
                usually anonymously. However, what one thinks as cyberbullying can be different 
                from another, each depending on their experiences of cyberbullying.
